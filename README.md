# squid3-ssl-docker

A Squid3 caching proxy with SSL enabled in a Docker container, based on
https://github.com/toffer/docker-squid3-ssl and meant to be used from within
other Docker containers.

## Details

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty).
* Squid (Version 3.3.8).
* Built from source, with `--enable-ssl`.
* Automatically generates self-signed certificate.
* Configured to cache Docker images (default config for Squid3 doesn't handle
  Docker images very well.)

## Usage

Start Squid3 setting its hostname and container name:

```
$ docker run -d -h proxy.docker.dev --name squid3 fgrehm/squid3-ssl:v20140809
```

Start another container linking it to the proxy container and setting the
`http_proxy` env var to the linked container:

```
$ docker run -ti --rm \
           --link squid3:proxy.docker.dev \
           -e http_proxy="http://proxy.docker.dev:3128" \
           ubuntu:trusty bash
```

You can check that things are working by hitting the same URL twice from within
a linked container and checking the `X-Cache` header that Squid sets in the
responses. The second response should show a cache hit:

```
$ curl -s -i http://httpbin.org/ip | grep 'X-Cache:'
X-Cache: MISS from proxy

$ curl -s -i http://httpbin.org/ip | grep 'X-Cache:'
X-Cache: HIT from proxy
```

### Caching HTTPS requests

To use the proxy for HTTPS requests, the linked container needs to trust the
self-signed certificate generated by the Squid3 server. To setup and install the
CA certificate on an Ubuntu container, try these steps:

```
# Start Squid3 setting its hostname and container name:
$ docker run -d -h proxy.docker.dev --name squid3 fgrehm/squid3-ssl:v20140809

# Save the certificate into a file
$ docker logs squid3 | sed -n '/BEGIN/,/END/p' > proxy.docker.dev.crt

# Start a new container doing the appropriate setup
$ docker run -ti --rm \
           --link squid3:proxy.docker.dev \
           -v `pwd`/proxy.docker.dev.crt:/usr/share/ca-certificates/proxy.docker.dev.crt \
           -e http_proxy="http://proxy.docker.dev:3128" \
           -e https_proxy="http://proxy.docker.dev:3128" \
           ubuntu:trusty bash

# From within the container, trust the certificate
$ apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
$ echo 'proxy.docker.dev.crt' >> /etc/ca-certificates.conf
$ /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
```

If your container gives you a way to "inject" scripts within its init process /
entrypoint, you can have that process automated.

For example, if you use [phusion/baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
you can create an executable script like the one below:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Install ca-certificates if needed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates ]; then
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates
fi

# Trust our certificate
if ! $(grep -q 'proxy.docker.dev.crt' /etc/ca-certificates.conf); then
  echo 'proxy.docker.dev.crt' >> /etc/ca-certificates.conf
  /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
fi
```

And run your containers like:

```
$ docker run -ti --rm \
           --link squid3:proxy.docker.dev \
           -v `pwd`/proxy.docker.dev.crt:/usr/share/ca-certificates/proxy.docker.dev.crt \
           -v `pwd`/proxy-script.sh:/etc/my_init.d/proxy-script.sh \
           -e http_proxy="http://proxy.docker.dev:3128" \
           -e https_proxy="http://proxy.docker.dev:3128" \
           phusion/baseimage /sbin/my_init -- bash -l
```

This will make sure that every time the container is brought up, it trusts the
proxy certificates and you don't need to do that by hand.

As with regular http requests, you can check that things are working by hitting
the same https URL twice from within a linked container (after trusting the
certificate) and checking the `X-Cache` header that Squid sets in the responses.
The second response should show a cache hit:

```
$ curl -s -i https://httpbin.org/ip | grep 'X-Cache:'
X-Cache: MISS from proxy

$ curl -s -i https://httpbin.org/ip | grep 'X-Cache:'
X-Cache: HIT from proxy
```

## Where does those `.deb`s come from?

I manually built the packages using a [separate Dockerfile](Dockerfile.build),
created a [GitHub release](https://github.com/fgrehm/squid3-ssl-docker/releases)
with a tarball of those debs and set up an [automated build](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/fgrehm/squid3-ssl)
on Docker Hub.

To perform the manual build, build the container
